# OPERATION-ANALYTICS-AND-INVESTIGATING-METRIC-SPIKE
In this project, Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes,
which involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key
metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As
a Data Analyst, we'll need to answer these questions daily, making it
crucial to understand how to investigate these metric spikes.
In this project, we'll take on the role of a Lead Data Analyst at a
company like Microsoft where we'll be provided with various datasets
and tables, and our task will be to derive insights from this data to
answer questions posed by different departments within the company.
